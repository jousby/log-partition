A Flink application project using Java and Gradle.

To package your job for submission to Flink, use: 'gradle shadowJar'. Afterwards, you'll find the
jar to use in the 'build/libs' folder.

To run and test your application with an embedded instance of Flink use: 'gradle run'

Requirements:

* Gradle 7+
* Java 8 (had issues running on Java17 but shouldn't be to hard to sort this out)
